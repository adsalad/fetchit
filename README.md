Discord bot coded in Python that returns hottest posts and their associated URL's from reddit.com

# Motivation

Main Takeaways:
- Learn API's, namely Discord's API
- Learning how bots work through asynchronous Python
- Diving into the world of side-projects with Discord.py was a little ambitious...

I love bots and reddit, and Discord and Slack are great services for hosting them. Slack lacks Python support for their bots so I used Discord.py to make a simple bot to return the top 5-10 posts from a user-selected subreddit. Commands are called when the bot is made online to return the desired results.
